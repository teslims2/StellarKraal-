-- Migration 001: Add soft delete support to loans and collateral tables
-- Run this against your production database when deploying soft-delete feature.

ALTER TABLE collateral ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "deletedAt" TEXT DEFAULT NULL;
ALTER TABLE loans      ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "deletedAt" TEXT DEFAULT NULL;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_collateral_deleted ON collateral("deletedAt");
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_loans_deleted      ON loans("deletedAt");

-- All existing queries should add WHERE "deletedAt" IS NULL to filter soft-deleted rows.
