## Project Overview

StellarKraal enables livestock-backed loans on the Stellar network. Animals are registered as collateral and borrowers can request loans against their appraised value, with on-chain loan lifecycle management and liquidation protection.

See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for release notes and upcoming changes.

```

### Architecture Summary

- Frontend: React + Next.js 14 with Tailwind CSS.
- Observability: backend metrics are scraped by Prometheus (alert rules in [`observability/prometheus-rules.yml`](observability/prometheus-rules.yml)); container logs are shipped by Promtail to Loki; Grafana visualizes both. See [docs/observability.md](docs/observability.md).
- Infrastructure: Terraform ([`terraform/`](terraform/) and [`infrastructure/`](infrastructure/)) provisions AWS resources (ECS Fargate, RDS, S3, VPC, backups, SNS/CloudWatch alerting) for staging/production.
- Backend: Node.js + TypeScript + Express.
- Smart contract: Rust using the Soroban SDK.
- Infrastructure: Docker, Docker Compose, local SQLite database.

## Local Development

> For a detailed, platform-specific walkthrough see **[docs/development/local-setup.md](docs/development/local-setup.md)**.

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following minimum versions are installed before you begin:

| Tool | Minimum version | Install |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| Node.js | **20.x** | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) or `nvm install 20` |
| npm | **10.x** (bundled with Node 20) | — |
| Rust | **1.78+** | `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs \| sh` |
| stellar-cli | **22+** | `cargo install --locked stellar-cli --features opt` |
| Docker & Docker Compose | **24+** (optional, for containerised setup) | [docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) |
| Freighter | latest | [freighter.app](https://www.freighter.app/) (browser extension) |

Verify your environment:

```bash
node --version   # v20.x or higher
npm --version    # 10.x or higher
rustc --version  # 1.78.x or higher
stellar --version # 22.x or higher
```

### Clone and setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/StellarKraal-.git
cd StellarKraal-
cp .env.example .env
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root containing:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK` | Stellar network to use | `testnet` |
| `RPC_URL` | Soroban JSON-RPC endpoint | `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org` |
| `CONTRACT_ID` | Deployed Soroban contract ID | `G...` |
| `PORT` | Backend service port | `3001` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | Frontend API base URL | `http://localhost:3001` |
| `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS` | Graceful shutdown drain timeout (ms, min 1000, default 10000). On SIGTERM/SIGINT the server stops accepting new connections and waits up to this duration for in-flight requests to complete before forcing exit. | `10000` |

### Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Access:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:3001`

### Run without Docker

#### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

#### OpenAPI Specification Generation

To auto-generate `openapi.json` from in-code `@openapi` route annotations:

```bash
cd backend
npm run openapi:generate
```

This scans all annotated route handlers, generates `backend/openapi.json`, and updates the spec version to match `package.json`. CI automatically verifies that `openapi.json` is not stale.

#### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Smart contract tests

```bash
cd contracts/stellarkraal
cargo test
```

### Common Setup Errors

| Symptom | Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-------|------------|
| `nvm: command not found` | nvm not installed | Install via [nvm install guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating), then `nvm install 20` |
| `npm ERR! code ERESOLVE` | Node version mismatch | Ensure Node.js 20+ (`node --version`). Delete `node_modules` and re-run `npm install`. |
| `sqlite3` build error | Missing native build tools | Run `npm rebuild sqlite3` after installing system build tools (see [local-setup.md](docs/development/local-setup.md)) |
| `stellar: command not found` | `~/.cargo/bin` not in PATH | Add `export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"` to your shell profile |
| `error[E0463]: can't find crate` | Wrong Rust toolchain | Run `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` inside `contracts/stellarkraal/` |
| `PORT already in use` | Port 3001 occupied | Stop the conflicting process or set a different `PORT` in `.env` |
| `Cannot connect to RPC_URL` | Network or config error | Verify `RPC_URL` in `.env` and network connectivity |
| CORS errors from frontend | `FRONTEND_URL` not set | Set `FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000` in your backend `.env` |

For a comprehensive troubleshooting guide including Docker, contract, and database errors, see
**[docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md)** or the platform-specific notes in
**[docs/development/local-setup.md](docs/development/local-setup.md)**.

## Staging Environment

The staging environment mirrors production and is deployed automatically on every merge to `main`.

| Resource | URL |
|---|---|
| Frontend | `https://staging.stellarkraal.example.com` |
| Backend API | `https://api-staging.stellarkraal.example.com` |

Staging uses Stellar **testnet** RPC and a separate contract deployment. The following GitHub Actions secrets must be set under the `staging` environment (Settings → Environments → staging):

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `STAGING_RPC_URL` | Soroban testnet RPC endpoint |
| `STAGING_CONTRACT_ID` | Staging contract deployment ID |
| `STAGING_API_URL` | Staging backend API base URL |
| `STAGING_FRONTEND_URL` | Staging frontend URL (for CORS) |
| `JWT_SECRET` | JWT signing key for staging |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | Slack webhook for deployment notifications |

To run the staging stack locally:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.staging.yml up -d
```

## Troubleshooting

Common errors and their resolutions are documented in **[docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md)**, covering:

- **Setup** — dependency conflicts, missing CLI tools, build failures, SQLite addon errors
- **Runtime** — port conflicts, RPC connectivity, CORS, JWT errors, Docker health checks
- **Contract** — invocation errors, sequence number mismatches, missing contract deployments
- **Database** — SQLite open failures, migration conflicts

Quick reference for the most frequent issues:

| Symptom | Resolution |
|---|---|
| `PORT already in use` | Stop the process on that port or change `PORT` in `.env` |
| `Cannot connect to RPC_URL` | Verify network and RPC endpoint reachability |
| `npm test` failures | Ensure dependencies are installed and Node.js 20+ is active |
| `Docker build` errors | Rebuild with `docker-compose build --no-cache` |

For anything not listed here, see the [full troubleshooting guide](docs/troubleshooting.md).

## Contribution Guidelines

This repository uses a documented contribution workflow. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for branch naming, commit style, PR template, and code review expectations.

### Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] Branch created from latest `main`
- [ ] Commit messages follow Conventional Commits
- [ ] Tests run successfully locally
- [ ] Documentation updated when necessary

## Lighthouse CI

Performance thresholds are enforced in `frontend/lighthouserc.js`. The CI Lighthouse job runs against the built app and **fails the build** if any score falls below:

| Category | Minimum Score |
|---|---|
| Performance | 80 |
| Accessibility | 90 |
| Best Practices | 90 |
| SEO | 80 |

Scores are reported as a GitHub Actions step summary.

## Security & Vulnerability Management

Dependencies are scanned automatically:

- **Dependabot** monitors `backend/`, `frontend/`, and `contracts/stellarkraal/` packages weekly. PRs are labelled `dependencies` and `security`. See [docs/guides/dependabot.md](docs/guides/dependabot.md) for the triage/merge process.
- **npm audit** runs every Monday via the [`npm-audit`](.github/workflows/npm-audit.yml) workflow. The workflow fails if any `high` or `critical` severity vulnerability is found.

To run an audit locally:

```bash
cd backend && npm audit --audit-level=high
cd frontend && npm audit --audit-level=high
```

To report a security vulnerability, please read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for our full vulnerability disclosure policy, reporting instructions, response timeline, and safe harbour statement.

## Development Scripts

Run the following from the repository root:

```bash
npm run test:contract
npm run test:backend
npm run test:frontend
```
